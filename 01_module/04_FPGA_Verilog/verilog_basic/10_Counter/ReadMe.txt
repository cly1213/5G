Verilog code for Up/Down Counter using Behavioral modelling
An up/down counter is a digital counter which can be set to count either from 0 to MAX_VALUE or MAX_VALUE to 0. The direction of the count(mode) is selected using a single bit input.

In this post, I have shared the Verilog code for a 4 bit up/down counter. The module has 3 inputs - Clk, reset which is active high and a UpOrDown mode input. The output is Counter which is 4 bit in size.
