Description
-----------
Simulates typical ADC impairments. Mask parameters control the degree of impairment simulated by the block.


Help
----
Minimum aperture delay and Maximum aperture delay: These control the aperture jitter for the ADC.

Nonlinear gain: This parameter controls the amount of nonlinear distortion in the ADC transfer function.

No. of quantization bits: Specifies the number of quantization bits for the ADC.
